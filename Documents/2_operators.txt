An operator is a symbol that performs a specific operation on one or more operands (values or variables). For example, in the expression 5 + 6, the + symbol is the operator that performs addition. In programming, operators can be used in various ways, such as performing arithmetic operations, comparing values, or assigning values to variables. Some common types of operators include arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, *, /), comparison operators (e.g., ==, !=, >, <), and assignment operators (e.g., =, +=, -=). The specific set of operators and how they behave can vary depending on the programming language being used.
